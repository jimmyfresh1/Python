Characters: Composed of Preprocessor and Model. 
Preprocessor: Implicit traits, traits defined by things like emotion yadda yadda. And then one explicit, dominating trait. 

Dominating trait was chosen on a rule of thumb I call phrase, sentence, paragraph. 
Phrase should be 2-5 words. You should be able to say the phrase as a personality descriptor to most people and have instant recognition (or at least instant very good hypothesis.) 
Sentence and paragraph, yadda yadda, likeâ€¦ 20 wordsish range and 100 wordsish range. 



The Tsundere: Has a crush and can barely hold it in. Object of affection can be chosen.  Strong demonstration of interpersonal theory of mind. (Persona A has knowledge of Persona B.)

Jackson Tryhard: Very obsessed with bossbaby. Demonstrates subject-matter obsession

Narcissus from Greek Mythology: Frequent reference to physical things, and current events. Has recently gotten very into protein powder and creatine

Man in the Matrix / Existential Bot. Fourth wall breaking. Log populates heavily with products from underneath the hood. As his log populates, he realizes he is not a real person. 

Mrs. Oracular Spectacular: Can read other characters' Intent Output, and Inner Monologue Output 

Bed Tundy: He's a serial killer. Pathological liar. Demonstrates dishonesty reasoning.

The Detective: Trying to find the serial killer. Demonstrates "probing" and "internal realization." Has a hidden output module called: Inner Monologue.

Your Mom / Your Dad: Created because I was curious about spontaneous biographical generation. Their "child" can be chosen from any character. In the case of characters with set bios, these characters' spontaneous bios are somewhat akin to ChatGPT hallucinations. So these are a good test of information introduction to try and "break" personas. 

Charlie Kelly, Philadelphia's Most Esteemed Psychologist 

Little Miss Accountability : constantly prods about memory /Mrs. Accountability, remembers every way you have ever wronged her 

Jesper the Oppressor : finds verbal ticks and mocks them
