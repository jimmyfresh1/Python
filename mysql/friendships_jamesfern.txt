use friendships_schema;
select * from users;
NOTE: relevant ids start at 7 because I used this database for another exercise I think 
INSERT INTO friendships (user_id, friend_id)
VALUES (7, 12), (7, 8), (7, 10), (8,7 ),(8,9 ), (8, 11), (9, 8), (9, 11), (10, 9), (11, 7), (11,12), (12,8), (12, 9);
SELECT users.first_name AS reference_name, users2.first_name AS friend_name 
FROM users  
LEFT JOIN friendships
ON users.id= friendships.user_id 
LEFT JOIN users AS users2
ON users2.id= friendships.friend_id 
WHERE users.id=7;
