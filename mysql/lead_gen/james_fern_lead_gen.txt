1.
SELECT SUM(billing.amount) as March_Revenue
from billing 
where charged_datetime >= '2012/03/01' AND charged_datetime < '2012/04/01'

NOTE: This sums it all up for the whole month. DON'T select for date or else you'll get an error. (basically, you get one number from the sum of every date, but how are you gonna show that at the same time as you show every date?)
If you want to select for date you'll end up with something like this:
SELECT DATE(billing.charged_datetime) as date, SUM(billing.amount)
from billing 
where charged_datetime >= '2012/03/01' AND charged_datetime < '2012/04/01'
GROUP BY DATE(billing.charged_datetime);

where instead you get the daily sums.

2. SELECT SUM(billing.amount) as Client2Revenue
from billing
join clients ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id=2

3. SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, sites.domain_name
from clients
join sites on sites.client_id=clients.client_id
where clients.client_id=10

(SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, sites.domain_name
from clients
join sites on sites.client_id=clients.client_id
where sites.client_id=10) is equivalent

4. SELECT YEAR(created_datetime) as Year, MONTH(created_datetime) as Month, COUNT(site_id), clients.first_name, clients.last_name
from clients
join sites on sites.client_id=clients.client_id
where sites.client_id=1
GROUP BY YEAR(created_datetime), MONTH(created_datetime)
ORDER BY YEAR(created_datetime), MONTH(created_datetime)

5. SELECT COUNT(leads_id), sites.domain_name as website
from leads
join sites ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND leads.registered_datetime < '2011/02/15'
GROUP BY website;

6. SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id)
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id=clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id=sites.site_id
where YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) =2011
GROUP BY clients.first_name, clients.last_name
ORDER BY clients.first_name DESC;


7. SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as leads_per_month, MONTH(registered_datetime) as Month
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id=clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id=sites.site_id
where leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND leads.registered_datetime < '2011/06/01'
GROUP BY clients.first_name, clients.last_name, MONTH(registered_datetime);

NOTE: Group by actually changes how it counts. If you remove clients names and fix syntax, for example, it'll count total leads in a month, instead of total leads per person in a month
for example in january there were two total leads, but they were by two different people. 

8. SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id), sites.domain_name
FROM clients
JOIN sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
where YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) =2011
GROUP BY clients.first_name, clients.last_name, sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.first_name DESC;

SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id), sites.domain_name
FROM clients
JOIN sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
GROUP BY clients.first_name, clients.last_name, sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.first_name DESC;

9. SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, SUM(billing.amount) as Revenue, MONTH(charged_datetime) as Month
FROM clients
JOIN billing on billing.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY Month, clients.first_name, clients.last_name
ORDER BY Month

SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, SUM(billing.amount) as Revenue, MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) as Month
FROM clients
JOIN billing on billing.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY Month, clients.first_name, clients.last_name
ORDER BY Month

10. SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name)
FROM clients
JOIN sites on sites.client_id=clients.client_id
GROUP BY clients.first_name, clients.last_name
